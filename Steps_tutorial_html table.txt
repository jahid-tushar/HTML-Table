Today we are going to learn how can we make table with HTML

3: Lets learn some basic html tag for making tables which can be easily learn through online ( W3School) 
3.1: HTML Tag for making table
<table> which define table 
<th> which defines a header in a table 
<tr> which defines or indicate row inside a table 
<td> it indicates cell data in a table
There are also other tags as example <col>, <caption>, <colgroup>

4:Now lets write our code 
[NB ] You can zoom in and zoom out by pressing ctr+scroll buttion
5: these three lines are common in any html code 
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head>

7: One thing I forgot to add save your file while working after sometime otherwise your code will be lost
